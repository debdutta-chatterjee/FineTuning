      " \n",
      " Brown, who has sold more than 81m copies of The Da Vinci Code worldwide, has been revealed as the most donated author to Oxfam's 700 high street shops. With just four books to his name – although his long-awaited fifth The Lost Symbol is published next month – Brown did well to see off competition from John Grisham, author of more than 20 and the second-most likely writer to be ditched in a charity shop by readers. \n",
      " \n",
      " But as secondhand bookshop shelves flood with battered editions of Angels and Demons and Digital Fortress, Brown can comfort himself with the fact that he's also Oxfam's second most bought author: there are, apparently, still readers out there who have yet to follow the adventures of the dapper symbologist Robert Langdon. There's no such consolation for Grisham, whose legal thrillers fail to make Oxfam's bestseller charts at all. \n",
      " \n",
      " \"There's no question that when you go into the back room of Oxfam shops there are many Dan Brown books,\" said Oxfam's director of trading David McCullough. \"But he's also very high on the bestseller list so there is a useful recycling exercise going on – it's not just people saying 'I've read The Da Vinci Code and now I must get rid of it'.\" \n",
      " \n",
      " Ian Rankin, whose dour, boozy detective John Rebus is no Robert Langdon, tops Oxfam's bestseller list, which the charity says is the first ever high-street secondhand bestseller chart. \"It's always good for an author to know that their books are popular,\" said the Scottish author, who will unveil a new policeman hero, the teetotal Malcolm Fox, next month. \"With Oxfam, it's also heartening to realise that each book donated and bought is helping such a worthwhile organisation.\" \n",

      " Margaret Atwood, meanwhile, winner of the Booker prize and author of a host of critically acclaimed works of fiction, scrapes into the list in eighth place, keeping unlikely company with thriller powerhouse James Patterson – currently producing at least eight books a year thanks to a horde of co-writers – and Jodi Picoult, never afraid to jerk a tear or pile on the plot twists. \n",
      " \n",
      " \"We just need to dispel the idea that we are sitting there in Oxfam with only first editions of literary gems – actually we've got shelves of really good fiction,\" said McCullough. \"Waterstone's might be more upset than secondhand booksellers,\" he added, referring to the recent slew of complaints from secondhand booksellers that the charity is stealing their business. \n",

      " Oxfam, Europe's biggest high-street retailer of secondhand books and the third-biggest bookseller in the UK, launched a drive for book donations in May ahead of its first national book festival, Bookfest, in July.

      " Staff who are struggling to sell copies of the book have put a note up in the store saying they would rather donors hand in their vinyl instead.\n",
      "Reference : – The Da Vinci Code has sold so many copies—that would be at least 80 million—that it's bound to turn up in book donation piles. But at one charity shop in the UK, it's been donated so heavily that the shop has posted a sign propped up on a tower of Da Vinci Code copies that reads: \"You could give us another Da Vinci Code... but we would rather have your vinyl!\" The manager of the Oxfam shop in Swansea tells the Telegraph that people are laughing and taking pictures of the sizable display: \"I would say that we get one copy of the book every day.\" He says people buy them \"occasionally,\" but with vinyl sales up 25% in the past year, they'd rather take records. Dan Brown's book isn't the only one that shops like Oxfam struggle to re-sell. Last year, Oxfam was hit with a large and steady supply of Fifty Shades of Grey, and it similarly begged donors: \"Please—no more.\" But Brown has a particular kind of staying power. The Da Vinci Code was published in 2003, and within six years Brown had booted John Grisham from the No. 1 slot on the list of writers whose books were most often donated to Oxfam's 700 shops, reported the Guardian at the time. The Independent in 2012 reported Brown's best-seller was the most-donated book for the fourth year running. (See why Dan Brown took heat from the Philippines.)\n",

This week, the agency was still working to process more than 58,000 student aid claims. \n",

      " On Wednesday, the VA announced that the information technology fixes will not be completed until December 2019 — more than a year past the original Aug. 1 deadline for finishing this work. This is a national disgrace, one that should prompt congressional leadership to move quickly on short- and long-term solutions. A good start would be swift passage of a Senate bill that would prohibit schools from penalizing student veterans for late VA assistance payments. This would address a major concern that students with accounts in arrears due to delayed payments may not be allowed to enroll for 2019 coursework. Given that the VA has said the tech problems will continue until the end of 2019, this protection is a sensible step. \n",

      " \n",
      " Other testimony provided at the hearing made it clear that long-term solutions are urgently needed, too. The VA has lacked a permanent chief information officer since January 2017, which is unacceptable given how technology is so critical to delivering service members’ benefits. \n",

      " A 2016 Government Accountability Office report put the age of the VA’s benefits delivery platform at more than a half century. At that time, other agencies, such as the Treasury Department, also had so-called “legacy systems” in that age range. “Many use outdated software and hardware parts that are unsupported,” the report warned. \n",
      " \n",
      " The GI Bill delay shows how a tweak to these dated systems can be complicated and time-consuming. There’s likely little appetite in Congress to tackle the daunting task of modernization, but leadership is sorely needed. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

      " For weeks, student veterans across the country have raised an alarm about delayed or incorrect GI Bill benefit payments, which the Department of Veterans Affairs has blamed on computer issues. \n",
      " \n",
      " But on Wednesday, the department told congressional staffers that it would not reimburse those veterans who were paid less than they were owed, two committee aides told NBC News. \n",
      " \n",
      " The news conflicts with a promise VA officials made to a House committee earlier this month that it would reimburse those veterans who received less than the full amount they were due. \n",
      " \n",
      " According to the aides, however, the VA said it could not make retroactive payments without auditing its previous education claims, which it said would delay future claims. The aides asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly. \n",
      " \n",
      " NBC News previously reported that some veterans were forced into desperate financial straits stemming from a change in calculating housing allowances under the Forever GI Bill, which President Donald Trump signed into law in July 2017. When its computers were unable to process that change, the VA quickly faced a backlog of veterans’ claims three times higher than normal. \n",
      " \n",
      " Because of those issues, the VA had announced earlier on Wednesday that it would delay the Forever GI Bill housing allowance changes until December 2019 — and again promised that retroactive payments would be made to those who did not receive a correct amount. \n",
      " \n",
      " But VA officials told congressional staffers in a telephone call on Wednesday morning that once the system is made right next year, they will not make retroactive payments to those who were underpaid because of the housing miscalculations. \n",
      " \n",
      " \"They are essentially going to ignore the law and say that that change only goes forward from December 2019,\" one aide told NBC News. \n",
      " \n",
      " The reason the VA decided that it would not make the retroactive payments is because it would have to audit all its previous education claims prior to December 2019, meaning the VA would potentially have to inspect 2 million claims, the aide said. \n",
      " \n",
      " VA officials said this could cause further delays in processing future claims, according to the aides, an issue that caused some veterans to suffer earlier this year. \n",
      " \n",
      " While this decision could mean the agency is flouting the law because it would not provide the correct amount of money to student veterans as required by two sections of the Forever GI Bill, the VA told the congressional staffers that they have a legal justification that would allow them to move forward with this decision. \n",
      " \n",
      " They did not share that justification, however. \n",
      " \n",
      " When asked for comment, a VA spokesman did not address the issue directly. Instead he reiterated that the agency would delay paying housing allowances in accordance with the new Forever GI Bill until the spring term of 2020 and instead pay housing allowances based on Department of Defense's older Basic Housing Allowance rates. \n",
      " \n",
      " Attempting to implement the law would put “an enormous administrative burden for schools in which some 35,000 certifying officials would have to track retroactively and re-certify hundreds of thousands of enrollment documents,” Curtis Cashour, the VA spokesman, said over email. \n",
      " \n",
      " Cashour also said that students who were overpaid because of the law’s changes or because of issues in implementing the law “will not be held liable for the debt.” \n",
      " \n",
      " But he did not comment on those who were underpaid and rampant confusion continues to surround the issue, as it is unknown how many students have been underpaid thus far, how many more could be underpaid because of the changes to the law and how much money these veterans are owed. \n",
      " \n",
      " Congressional aides described the situation as “frustrating.” One, who commented on the shifting answers and constant confusion stemming from VA, asked, “I mean, am I taking crazy pills?” \n",

      " \n",
      " The big delay comes after months of technology hiccups that have plagued the agency, which failed to meet the original Aug. 1 deadline to put the changes in place. These problems have contributed to a backlog of claims for veterans using the Post-9/11 GI Bill to attend school this fall, and the agency has come under fire in recent months as thousands of student veterans have had to wait longer than usual for their tuition and housing payments. \n",
      " \n",
      " “Redesigning the way (Veterans Benefits Administration) calculates Post-9/11 GI Bill housing rates during a busy academic season was like flying a plane while building it, and that was unfair and frustrating to veterans and taxpayers. That’s why we are resetting our implementation of the law for the next year to ensure we get the technology and formula right to put Veterans first,” VA Sec. Robert Wilkie said in a news release. “In the meantime, beneficiaries receiving Post 9/11 GI Bill housing allowances will be paid at the DoD (basic housing allowance) rate, which in many cases will be equal to or higher than their current payment.” \n",

      " Congressional leaders who have taken the VA to task for the slow implementation said Wednesday they are glad Wilkie is choosing to focus on getting student veterans their payments, even if it means pushing back the deadline for the IT updates to be completed. \n",
      " \n",
      " “While I am disappointed that the VA does not yet have an effective IT system in place, I understand Secretary Wilkie’s decision to reset implementation of certain sections of the ‘Forever’ GI Bill while improvements continue to be made,” Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., said in a statement. “Right now, the VA’s priority must be to ensure accurate payments are sent to student veterans in a timely manner. Student veterans rely on the GI Bill to support themselves and their families while they are in school, and the VA is responsible for keeping those payments going, even as it implements the new law.” \n",
      " \n",
      " Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., whose House Committee on Veterans Affairs’ pressed VA leaders for a new deadline in a hearing on Capitol Hill earlier this month, said Wilkie’s move “will ensure that monthly housing payments are made with minimal delays.” \n",

      "Reference : – A major snafu has hit benefit payments to student veterans under the GI Bill—and congressional aides tells NBC that they have been told the veterans are never going to be paid back. The aides say they were told by the Department of Veterans Affairs that the VA will not be making retroactive payments to veterans who were underpaid for their housing allowance because it would mean reviewing around 2 millions claims, further delaying implementation of a new system, which has already been pushed back to Dec. 2019. Under the Forever GI Bill signed into law by President Trump last year, students are supposed to be paid housing allowance based on where they take the most classes, not on where the school's main campus is located. Tanya Ang, vice president of Veterans Education Success, tells the Military Times that the VA's excuse of retroactive payments creating too much work isn't good enough. \"That could be hundreds of dollars for some students—per month,\" she says. \"If this was a disability benefit, this would never fly.\" The issue, which is the result of new legislation being introduced before the VA's outdated computer system could handle it, has contributed to a backlog of claims that has forced some veterans facing financial hardship to abandon their studies, the Tennessean reports. The agency is still working to process more than 58,000 claims, reports the Star Tribune. The paper's editorial board calls the delays a \"national disgrace.\" \"Those courageous enough to go into battle should face zero delays in getting the education benefits they’ve earned,\" they write.\n",
